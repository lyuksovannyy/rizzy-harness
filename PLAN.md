# harness — plan

Working name `harness`. The name lives in exactly two kinds of places:
`harness_core::APP_NAME` (used for the binary banner, data dir, cookie name,
env-var prefix) and the Cargo package names (`harness-*`). A rename is a
search-and-replace over `Cargo.toml` files plus that one constant.

Status notes are appended at the bottom (`## Status`).

                                                                    ▼
 node runtime: session actors · agent backend (native loop) · tools
               node store (node.db): authoritative event log
               node policy (node.toml): authoritative permissions
```

* **The agent loop runs on the node that owns the session.** The master never
  executes tools. It mirrors the node's log and forwards commands.
* **Single writer.** A session's events are appended only by its owning node's
  session actor. `seq` is assigned by that actor, contiguous from 1.
* **Event sourcing.** Everything the UI shows is a fold over the event log.
  There is no other session state that matters for display.
* **One code path for local and remote nodes.** A `NodeLink` is a pair of
  channels carrying `protocol::NodeToMaster` / `protocol::MasterToNode`.
  The embedded node gets the channels directly; a remote node (Phase 2) gets
  them bridged over a WebSocket. The master-side handling is identical.

### Workspace

| crate | role | phase |
|---|---|---|
| `harness-core` | `APP_NAME`, ids, event schema (typed + raw), session fold, approval policy types, `Secret` | 1 |
| `harness-store` | SQLite event log (node + mirror modes), cursors, session index | 1 |
| `harness-protocol` | versioned master⇄node messages | 1 |
| `harness-tools` | bash (process-group kill), read, edit/write, grep, glob | 1 |
| `harness-agent-native` | native agent loop, `Provider` trait, OpenAI-compatible streaming provider | 1 |
| `harness-node` | node runtime, session actors, backend trait, policy enforcement | 1 |
| `harness-master` | axum server, auth, mirror, router, WS fan-out, embedded SPA | 1 |
| `harness` (crates/cli) | single binary: `serve`, `doctor`, `node join`, `pair` | 1 (join/pair in 2) |
| `harness-skills`, `harness-mcp` | added in Phase 4, not scaffolded empty | 4 |

Change from the brief: `skills/` and `mcp/` are **not** scaffolded as empty
crates in Phase 0. Empty crates rot and add CI time; they are created in
Phase 4 when they have content.

### Data dir

`$HARNESS_DATA_DIR` or `~/.local/share/harness/` (`dirs` crate):
`master.db`, `node.db`, `ui-token` (0600), `harness.toml`, `node.toml`,
later `keys/`.

The embedded node keeps its **own** `node.db` even though it shares a process
with the master. That duplicates data on a single machine but means
replication and resume-by-cursor are exercised from Phase 1, not first in
Phase 2.

---

## 2. Event schema (decision: expensive to reverse, fixed here)

Wire/storage form (`RawEvent`) — what the store and protocol carry:

```json
{ "session_id": "0193…(uuid v7)", "seq": 17, "ts_ms": 1767225600000,
  "kind": "tool_call_started", "payload": { … } }
```

* `(session_id, seq)` is the primary key and the idempotency key.
  `seq` starts at 1 and is contiguous; a gap is a bug or a missing replay.
* The master mirror stores `kind` and `payload` **opaquely**. An older master
  can mirror events from a newer node; it just renders unknown kinds generically.
* Typed form (`harness_core::EventKind`) is a serde enum with
  `tag = "kind", content = "payload"`. Unknown kinds deserialize to an error at
  the typed layer only; the raw layer never fails on them.
* Payload changes are additive only (new optional fields). A breaking change is
  a new kind.

Kinds (v1):

| kind | payload |
|---|---|
| `session_created` | `title, cwd, model, backend, node_id` — always seq 1 (**added**: needed so the log alone describes the session) |
| `turn_started` | `turn_id` |
| `user_message` | `turn_id, text` |
| `assistant_delta` | `turn_id, message_id, text` — coalesced, see below |
| `assistant_message` | `turn_id, message_id, text, tool_calls[{call_id, tool, input}]` — authoritative full text |
| `tool_call_started` | `turn_id, call_id, tool, input` |
| `tool_output_delta` | `call_id, stream (stdout/stderr), text` |
| `tool_call_finished` | `call_id, ok, output, exit_code?, truncated` — `output` is what the model sees |
| `approval_requested` | `approval_id, call_id, tool, input, reason` |
| `approval_resolved` | `approval_id, decision (allow/deny/allow_session), by (user/policy/cancelled/interrupted)` |
| `checkpoint` | `turn_id, phase (before/after), git_ref` — Phase 3 |
| `turn_ended` | `turn_id, reason (completed/cancelled/error/interrupted), usage?` |
| `error` | `turn_id?, message` |

**Delta coalescing (decision).** One event per token is wasteful for SQLite and
replay. The native loop buffers deltas and flushes an `assistant_delta` /
`tool_output_delta` every 75 ms or 2 KiB, whichever first. `assistant_message`
carries the full text, so the UI and the provider history never depend on
deltas being complete — deltas are a display optimisation.

**Crash recovery (decision).** On node start, every session whose last turn has
`turn_started` but no `turn_ended` gets, in order: `approval_resolved{by:
interrupted, decision: deny}` for each open approval, `error`, and
`turn_ended{reason: interrupted}`. Turns are not auto-resumed: re-running
half-finished side effects is worse than asking the user to continue.

**Durability.** The node store runs WAL with `synchronous=FULL`: an event is
fsynced before it is published to anyone, so a seq the master has seen can
never be reused after a node crash or power loss. The mirror uses
`synchronous=NORMAL` — it can always re-fetch from the node.

### Fold

`harness_core::SessionView::apply(&RawEvent)` is the single reference reducer
(messages, tool cards, pending approvals, turn status). The SPA has a TypeScript
port of the same reducer. "Replay to exact state" is tested as:
`fold(all events) == fold(events seen before crash ++ events after reconnect)`
with the seq sequence strictly contiguous.

---

## 3. Node protocol (decision: expensive to reverse, fixed here)

JSON messages, `{"type": "...", ...}`, `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 1`. Version is
negotiated in `node.hello` / `master.welcome`; a mismatch in major version
closes the link with a reason.

Node → master
* `node.hello {protocol_version, node_id, hostname, version, capabilities, sessions: [{session_id, head_seq}]}`
* `session.event {event: RawEvent}`
* `session.snapshot {session_id, head_seq, events: [RawEvent]}` — a replay batch answering `resume`
* `ack {req_id, ok, error?}`

Master → node
* `master.welcome {protocol_version}`
* `session.create {req_id, session_id, title, cwd, model?}` — master mints the uuid v7
* `session.prompt {req_id, session_id, text}`
* `session.cancel {req_id, session_id}`
* `approval.respond {req_id, session_id, approval_id, decision}`
* `resume {session_id, last_seq}`

**Replication rule (master side):** for an incoming event with
`seq == mirror_head + 1` → store and fan out; `seq <= mirror_head` → drop
(duplicate); `seq > mirror_head + 1` → drop and send `resume{last_seq:
mirror_head}` (at most one outstanding per session). On hello, the master
sends `resume` for every session where `node.head_seq > mirror_head`, and
creates mirror rows for sessions it has never seen. This makes the link
self-healing with no ordering assumptions beyond per-session FIFO.

Pairing (Phase 2): Ed25519 identities on both sides. Node runs
`harness node join <master-url>`; master shows the node fingerprint; operator
approves it in the UI (or `harness pair approve <fp>`); key is pinned. Each
connection is a challenge-response over the TLS channel (both sides sign a
nonce bound to the session). The node pins the master's key on first use
(SSH-style) and refuses a changed key loudly.

---

## 4. Threat model

The master can make nodes run shell commands. Treat it as an RCE service with a
login page.

**Assets:** shell on every node; source code; provider API keys; the UI login.

**Adversaries and mitigations**

| # | Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | Network attacker reaches the master UI | Bind `127.0.0.1` by default. Non-loopback bind requires TLS (Phase 2) or the explicit `--insecure-bind` flag (tailnet/WireGuard mode), which logs a warning on every start. |
| T2 | Malicious website in the user's browser (CSRF, DNS rebinding, cross-site WS) | Auth is a 256-bit random token exchanged once via `POST /api/login` for an `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` cookie. Every request checks `Host` against an allowlist (anti-rebinding) and every state-changing request and the WS upgrade check `Origin`. Token compared in constant time. |
| T3 | Secrets leak via logs, URLs, event log | Provider keys are referenced by env-var name in config, held in `Secret<String>` (redacted `Debug`), never put in events. Tool output is scrubbed of known secret values before it is stored. No token in any URL (no `?token=`). `tracing` never logs headers. |
| T4 | Prompt injection from repo content makes the model run harmful commands | Default approval mode `ask`: every mutating tool (bash, edit, write) needs a human click; read-only tools are confined to the session workspace. No network sandbox in v1 (open risk R2). |
| T5 | Compromised master widens node permissions | **Node-local policy (`node.toml`) is authoritative** and is not settable over the protocol: allowed workspace roots, max approval mode (`ask` default; master can request stricter, never looser), tool denylist, whether remote-created sessions are allowed at all. The node logs every command it received in its own store. |
| T6 | Compromised master approves things on nodes | Accepted in v1: the master is the approval channel, so a compromised master can approve anything inside node policy. Bounded by T5. Future: approvals signed by a user device key verified on the node (R1). |
| T7 | Rogue node / stolen node key | Node keys pinned after operator approval; revocation deletes the pin and drops the link. A node only writes its own sessions; the master rejects events for sessions owned by another node. |
| T8 | MITM on the node link | WSS plus Ed25519 mutual challenge-response with pinned keys, so a mis-issued TLS cert alone is not enough. |
| T9 | Runaway processes | Bash runs in its own process group; cancel/timeout sends SIGTERM then SIGKILL to the group. Cancel propagates master → node as `session.cancel`. Output is capped. |

## 5. Decisions taken (beyond section 2 of the brief)

* **SQLite via `rusqlite` (bundled)**, not sqlx: synchronous, simple, no
  compile-time DB, single static binary. Calls go through `spawn_blocking`.
* **HTTP client `reqwest` 0.13 with rustls**; SSE parsed by hand (≈40 lines)
  rather than an unmaintained `eventsource-stream` (last release 2022).
* **Process-group kill via `nix::sys::signal::killpg`** (safe API, no `unsafe`
  in our code); `tokio::process::Command::process_group(0)`.
* **Approval modes:** `ask_all` (every tool), `ask` (default: mutating tools),
  `auto`. Decisions: `allow`, `deny`, `allow_session` (this tool, rest of session).
* **UI ⇄ master:** REST for commands, one WebSocket for streams. Client sends
  `subscribe{session_id, after_seq}`; server subscribes to live broadcast
  *before* reading the DB backlog, then drops live events `<= last sent seq`, so
  there is no window where an event is missed or doubled.
* **Mock provider** (`provider = "mock"`) ships in the binary: deterministic
  scripted replies with tool calls. Used by tests and for trying the UI without
  an API key.
* **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite + TypeScript 5.9 (not TS 7 — boring choice),
  no UI framework, hand-written CSS. `web/dist` is embedded via `rust-embed`;
  a `build.rs` creates an empty `web/dist` if missing so `cargo test` works
  without Node; the server then serves a "UI not built" page.
* **Phase 1 binds loopback only**; TLS arrives with the node link in Phase 2.
* **MCP:** use the official `rmcp` crate (verified: crates.io `rmcp`, repo
  `modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk`, 3.8.0 as of 2026-10-26). Pin at Phase 4 start.

## 6. Licences of references

None of their code is copied. Ideas only. Verified: this repo is MIT.
Moltis, esper-relay are stated MIT and vibe-kanban Apache-2.0 in the brief;
Mjolnir GPL-3.0 (docs only). **Not verified by me:** sci-pi's licence (brief
says none visible — treat as all-rights-reserved), agentic-harness maturity,
DeepSeek Harness UI licence. If any pattern from the DeepSeek UI is ported
literally, its MIT notice goes in `web/THIRD_PARTY.md`.

## 7. Open risks

* **R1** Master compromise = approval forgery within node policy (T6).
* **R2** No OS sandbox for bash in v1 (landlock / bubblewrap later).
* **R3** Coalesced deltas mean the UI can lag up to 75 ms; acceptable.
* **R4** OpenAI-compatible servers differ on streamed tool-call chunking
  (index vs id); the parser keys by `index` and tolerates missing ids. Tested
  against recorded chunk shapes, not every vendor.
* **R5** The UI token is a single shared secret (single-user v1). Multi-user is
  out of scope.
* **R6** Two-db embedded mode doubles disk usage on the master machine.

---

## 8. Phases and gates

* **Phase 0** — workspace, CI (fmt, clippy -D warnings, test, web build), this plan.
* **Phase 1** — master + embedded node, native loop, OpenAI-compatible provider
  with streaming, bash/read/edit/write/grep/glob with approvals, event log, SPA
  (session list, chat, tool cards, approvals). **Gate:** an automated test kills
  the real binary mid-turn, restarts it, reconnects a WS client from its cursor
  and asserts contiguous seqs, no duplicates, and identical folded state.
* **Phase 2** — `node join`, pairing, WSS link, replication over the network,
  node badge. **Gate:** simulated network drops mid-turn ⇒ no gaps/dups;
  cancel from master kills the remote process tree.
* **Phase 3** — worktree per session, checkpoints, diffs, revert/fork, terminal.
* **Phase 4** — `harness-mcp` (rmcp, stdio + streamable HTTP, `server_tool`
  namespacing, per-session enablement), `harness-skills` (SKILL.md frontmatter,
  progressive loading).
* **Phase 5** — ACP backend, Anthropic provider (API key only; no subscription
  OAuth), compaction, subagents, full-text search.
